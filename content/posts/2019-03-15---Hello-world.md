Hello World!

First blog post to test Gatsby combined with Firebase Hosting & CircleCI.

 ## GatsbyJs
Gatsby seems to be super easy to create static pages like this one. I used a themed template from their website and it worked out of the box. It was quite complicated to add LinkedIn to the left sidebar but it worked in the end.

This website/blog is also available [on github](https://github.com/AlexanderThiele/thiele.dev-website)! It's forked from the template and a little bit adjusted.

 ## Firebase Hosting
Hosting seems very easy by just typing firebase deploy. HTTPS is included which makes it hassle free ðŸ¥³

You can also automate your deployments with CircleCI, Jenkins etc.

 ## CircleCI
I used CircleCI to automatically generate all static pages and deploy all changes to Firebase Hosting when a new commit appears on master. 

CirlceCI is super powerful and easy to use. I can definitely recommend it for your CI/CD! 

### Thanks!

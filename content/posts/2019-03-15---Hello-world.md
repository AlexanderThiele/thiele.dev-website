Hello World!

This is a test to try out Gatsby combined with Firebase Hosting.

 ## Firebase Hosting
Hosting seems very easy by just typing firebase deploy. HTTPS is included which makes it hassle free ðŸ¥³

 ## GatsbyJs
Gatsby seems to be super easy to create static pages like this one. I used a themed template from their website. It was quite complicated to add LinkedIn to the left sidebar but in the end it worked.

 ## Github
Everything is saved on Github ðŸ¥°
